# RAG Tutorial
This repository provides a beginner-friendly implementation of Naive RAG, designed for those who want to try it out without any complex setup. The system leverages the [intfloat/multilingual-e5-large](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-large) model to generate embeddings and uses `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` for the generation part. Additionally, the implementation is built on the `langchain` library and makes use of a dataset consisting of Japanese fictional stories generated by `GPT-4o`.

## Requirements
Since `sentence_transformers` or its dependencies (`torch` or `transformers`) are not compatible with `Numpy 2.x`, we will install `Numpy 1.x` instead.
```bash
pip install sentence_transformers langchain-community faiss-cpu pandas openai numpy==1.26.4
```
## Configuration
1. Set your `API_KEY` in `config/key.py`.
2. If necessary, adjust the paths in `config/path.py` accordingly.

## Usage
Run the following command to execute the script:
```bash
python rag.py
```
